## 🎓 Technical Highlights to Mention

### For Technical Audience
- Modern React 18 with TypeScript
- Serverless architecture (scales automatically)
- PWA with offline support
- Type-safe database queries (Drizzle ORM)
- Secure authentication (bcrypt)
- Bundle size optimized (code splitting)
- Performance-focused (lazy loading)

### For Business Audience
- Fast development cycle
- Low infrastructure costs ($0-9/month for POC)
- Scalable to millions of users
- Mobile-first (where parents are)

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Be Honest!)

### For POC Only (Acceptable)
1. **User Context** - Hardcoded to baby ID 1 (single baby)
2. **Media Upload** - Schema ready, UI pending
3. **Data Export** - Page exists, functionality coming
4. **Multi-baby Support** - Coming in Phase 2

### Documented Workarounds
- Focus demo on one baby (Emma)
- Use text notes instead of photos
- Direct database export if needed
- Everything documented in QUICK_START_POC.md
