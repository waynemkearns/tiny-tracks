Certainly — here is the updated product/UX brief incorporating the user feedback that initial notes are typically made about Feed, Change, and similar core events, and users want a way to consolidate these into TinyTracks. This version includes design, functionality, data structure, and privacy considerations — ready for development scoping.

📥 Feature Brief: Support for Uploading and Attaching External Notes & Screenshots

💡 User Feedback

“I’m using Apple Notes and screenshots to jot down details about feeds, nappies, or health issues, especially when I don’t have time to log them properly in the moment. Can TinyTracks support uploading or attaching these later?”

⸻

🎯 Summary of User Need

Parents often use quick external tools (like Apple Notes, photos, voice memos, WhatsApp) to capture:
	•	Feeds (e.g. unusual feeding times or skipped feed)
	•	Nappy changes (e.g. color/consistency photos or text notes)
	•	Symptoms (e.g. rashes, vomiting, temperature logs)
	•	Doctor prep (e.g. questions, timelines)

They want an easy way to consolidate these informal records into TinyTracks later — ideally by attaching them to the appropriate event type (Feed, Change, etc.) or saving them as part of a health timeline.

✅ Feature Scope & Design Recommendations

1. Universal Notes & Upload Attachments for Core Logs

📌 Supported Log Types:
	•	🍼 Feed
	•	🧷 Change
	•	💤 Sleep
	•	📈 Growth
	•	🚨 Health Notes

✍️ Functionality:
	•	On each log screen (e.g., Feed entry), add:
	•	“Add Note”: free text entry with auto-timestamp
	•	“Attach Image”: upload screenshot or photo (file picker or camera roll)
	•	Users can:
	•	Attach multiple notes/images to one entry
	•	Review attached content in timeline or expanded entry view
	•	Optionally tag notes (e.g., “doctor follow-up”, “unusual”, “pattern”)

⸻

2. Dedicated Notes & Uploads Section

Alternative Entry:
	•	A standalone section: 📝 “Captured Notes & Screenshots”
	•	Users can:
	•	Upload images or paste text not tied to a specific log
	•	Later link or assign that note to a log type (e.g., retroactively add to “Feed” on June 5th at 3pm)

⸻

📂 Data Model & Storage
	•	Extend existing log schema with:
	•	attachedNotes[]: array of free-text entries
	•	attachedMedia[]: array of image URIs + timestamps
	•	Allow linking uploaded note to:
	•	A specific event ID (e.g., Feed log)
	•	A date/time range (e.g., 3am–5am, if precise time is unknown)

⸻

🔐 Privacy & Security
	•	All images and notes:
	•	Stored securely (encrypted at rest & in transit)
	•	Remain local-first unless user enables cloud backup
	•	Never shared unless included in an explicit export or summary
	•	Offer a setting to auto-delete temporary uploads after export or after X days

⸻

🧠 Optional Future Enhancements
	•	Voice-to-text notes (for hands-free journaling)
	•	OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from screenshots (e.g., temperature logs)
	•	Smart tagging (e.g., “this note matches recent diaper entry” suggestion)
